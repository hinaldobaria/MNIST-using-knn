# MNIST Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project aims to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project uses the KNN algorithm to classify these digits. The KNN algorithm is a simple, instance-based learning method where the class of a sample is determined based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbors.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and reshaping of the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Implementation**: KNN algorithm for digit classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy assessment of the KNN model on the MNIST test set.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-knn.git
   cd mnist-knn

### Results
- The KNN model achieves an accuracy of approximately **97%** on the MNIST test dataset. For detailed results and plots, refer to the mnist_knn.ipynb.
